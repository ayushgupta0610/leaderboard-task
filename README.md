This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
# or
yarn i && yarn dev
# or
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/24hr](24 hour) or [http://localhost:3000/all-time](All Time) with your browser to see the 24 hour or All time leaderboard respectively.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
